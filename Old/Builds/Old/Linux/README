This is old -- see ../CSL_JUCE for builds using introjucer

For CSL 5.0, we include a premake script for creating a makefile (just like JUCE uses). This has been tested and can compile the CSL JUCE demo app.

To use this:
	./runpremake
	make

To change the project, edit the CSL_premake.lua script.

There's also a zipped Eclipse project file with the CSL sources.

Here are the old instructions

---

To compile CSL on Linux (we use Eclipse):

1) Make sure that the following packages are installed:
	JUCE 1.50

2) In Eclipse, create a new C++/console project 

3) Import the source files in the ../CSL/* directories

4) Add the following linker flags
	-lm -lplthread -ljucedebug

5) Turn off C++ warnings

6) Choose which main to use (start with Beep_demo.cpp)

7) Compile/Link/Run it!
