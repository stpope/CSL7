/** 
A panning technique that uses amplitude as the method for sound placement (just as stereo panning does).
When multiple speakers are present, sets of all possible adjacent speaker pairs or in triples (depending if doing
3D or only 2D panning) are found, reducing the "Active speakers" to two or three. See Pulkki for more info.

/*// **** SPEAKER TRIPLET LAYOUT  ***** 
TO AVOID BUILDING A TRIPLET LAYOUT PER VBAP INSTANCE, THE VBAP CLASS WILL HAVE A STATIC METHOD THAT 
RETURS A MAP OF THE SPEAKER LAYOUT (KEY) AND THE TRIPLET SPEAKER LAYOUT (VALUE). THIS WAY, IF ANOTHER
INSTANCE HAS ALREADY CREATED A TRIPLET LAYOUT (IN OTHER WORDS IF A NEW INSTANCE IS USING THE SAME LAYOUT
THAN THE ALREADY CREATED INSTANCE) THEN A POINTER TO THE TRIPLET LAYOUT WILL BE RETURNED.
AS AN ALTERNATIVE, INSTEAD OF A MAP, THE TRIPLET SPEAKER LAYOUT WILL HOLD A POINTER TO THE SPEAKER LAYOUT
AND WILL BE ABLE TO COMPARE TO A PASSED POINTER. IN THES CASE, A STATIC VECTOR OF TRIPLET LAYOUTS WOULD HOLD
THE ALREADY CREATED TRIPLET LAYOUTS AND WHEN CREATING A NEW VBAP INSTANCE, IT WOULD GO THRU EACH TRIPLET LAYOUT
(IF ANY) COMPARING SPEAKER LAYOUT ADDRESSES. IF A MATCH IS FOUND, THE TRIPLET LAYOUT WOULD BE SET TO BE THE OBJECT
HELD BY THE VBAP INSTANCE (EACH VBAP INSTANCE WILL KEEP ITS OWN POINTER TO ITS TRIPLET LAYOUT OBJECT. FOR THIS TO WORK
SOME SORT OF COUNT WILL BE NEEDED SO WHEN NO OBJECT IS KEEPING A TRIPLET, THEN IT SHOULD GET DESTROYED.
WHEN SETTING THE SPEAKER LAYOUT, THE OBJECT WILL HAVE TO SEARCH AGAIN FOR TRIPLET LAYOUTS ALREADY CREATED, AND RE COMPUTE 
ONE IF NONE EXISTS.
ADVANTAGES: 
	A) THE TRIPLET FINDING GOES TO THE LAYOUT AND AWAY FROM THE VBAP, SIMPLIFYING THE VABAP INTERFACE.
	B) SAVES MEMORY USAGE BY HAVING ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF TRIPLETS FOR EACH LAYOUT USED.
		IN MOST CASES, ONLY ONE LAYOUT IS USED, WHICH TRANSLATIES INTO ONLY ONE SET OF TRIPLETS IN MEMORY.
	C) SAVES COMPUTATION BY NOT RECALCULATING TRIPLETS FOR EACH VBAP INSTANCE. IT DOES IT ONLY ON ONE.
	
COST:
	A) COMPUTATIONALLY THE COST IS MINIMAL. AT INSTANTIATION TIME, THE OBJECT HAS TO SEARCH THRU A VECTOR. 
		THIS BECOMES NULL IF NO OBJECTS ARE USED AND INSIGNIFICANT WHEN ONE OR MORE OBJECTS ARE INSTANTIATED.
	B) REGARDING MEMORY, IT'LL HAVE TO LOAD STATICALLY A VECTOR AT APP LOAD TIME...
