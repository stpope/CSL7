///  Binaural.h -- Specification of the HRTF-based binaural spatializer.
///		This is the CSL 5 version that uses the FFT wrapper framework
///
/// Classes
///		BinauralPanner: place sources in 3D using block-wise convolution with an HRTF;
///		best heard over headphones. Supports multiple moving sources and does cached
///		multi-block FFT/IFFT convolution.
///
///		BinauralSourceCache: used for caching previous state of spatial sources.
///
/// The companion file has the classes
///		HRTF: holds the data that corresponds to an HRTF for a single position.
///		HRTFDatabase: vector of HRTFs; implemented as a Singleton because it's large.
///
///	See the copyright notice and acknowledgment of authors in the file COPYRIGHT
///	Created by Jorge Castellanos on 7/19/06.
///	Inspired by and partially based on the VST HRTF Plug-in written by Ryan Avery.
///	Rewritten for FFT wrappers and pluggable sound file APIs in 8/09 by STP.
///
/// @todo HRTFs should be equalized, currently they are being loaded and used raw.
/// @todo Interpolation of HRTFs. Currently the closest HRTF is being used.
