///  BinauralDB.h -- Specification of the HRTF file format and database
///		This is the CSL 5 version that uses the FFT wrapper framework
///
/// Classes
///		HRTF: holds the data that corresponds to an HRTF for a single position
///		as a stereo pair of multi-block arrays of complex spectra.
///		2 channels * 16 blocks * 512-complex-float arrays
///		There is support in the code for taking a subset of the HRIR and changing the block size.
///
///		HRTFDatabase: vector of HRTFs; implemented as a Singleton because it's large.
///		Has a vector of HRTFs and can access them by position -- hrtfAt(CPoint) --
///		or by index -- hrtfAt(unsigned). Create it with a folder/resource name, 
///		it reads "files.txt" for a list of HRIR files to load.
///		This has a number of file/folder/DB IO methods for load/store of bulk HRTF 
///		data sets in IRCAM format and CSL's pre-processed HRTF.dat files.
///
/// The companion file has the classes
///		BinauralPanner: place sources in 3D using block-wise convolution with an HRTF;
///			best heard over headphones .
///		BinauralSourceCache: used for caching previous state of spatial sources.
///
///	See the copyright notice and acknowledgment of authors in the file COPYRIGHT
///	Created by Jorge Castellanos on 7/19/06.
///	Inspired by and partially based on the VST HRTF Plug-in written by Ryan Avery.
///	Rewritten for FFT wrappers and pluggable sound file APIs in 8/09 by STP.
///
/// @todo HRTFs should be equalized, currently they are being loaded and used raw.
/// @todo Interpolation of HRTFs. Currently the closest HRTF is being used.
///
///	CSL HRTF.dat file format
///		Header = a string with the label and geometry list,
///		label is: "HRTF"  name  #-hrtfs  HRIR-len  blk-size  #-blocks
///			as in, HRTF   1047  188      8192      512       16
///
///		geometry is a cr-separated list of 2 integers per line of the azim/elev 
///		in degrees of the points; empty line ends list.
///
///		Header is followed by the per-head, per-spsition, blocked HRTF complex vectors.
///		2-16 blocks/set, each has 257 or 513 complex values for L and R
///			for full-len HRIR, this = 8 * 2 * 513 * 16 = 131 kB / HRTF * 188 = 24.6 MB / DB
///
///		Trailer is "\nHRTF\n"
///		The methods storeToDB() and loadFromDB() implement this format.
