% This is a data file used to describe the layout of LSpeakers of the VBAP classes.
% It is meant to be used by the VBAP::read_layout_file("filename" ) method of the VBAP classes developed by
% Doug McCoy for his Master's thesis at UCSB. 
% all lines with a '%' character are treated as comments from the '%' to the end of the line
% Syntax:

mode: 3					% (either 2 or 3) if 2, second column is ignored
speaker:	30		0		% azimuth  is measured from the x axis within the x/y plane (-180 < azi <= 180)
						% elevation is measured perpendicularly from the x/y plane  (-90 < ele <= 90)
						% all points are assumed to be unit length from the origin
speaker:	-30		0
speaker:	-90		0
speaker:	-150		0
speaker:	150		0
speaker:	90		0
speaker:	0		90
