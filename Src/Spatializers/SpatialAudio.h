// SHOULD REVERB BE PART OF THE AURALIZER? OR THE SPATIALIZER?
// TO AN EXTENT, ADDING REVERB IS ALREADY A VERY COARSE ATTEMPT TO SIMULATE A SPACE, MAKING IT PART OF AURALIZER
// BUT A SPATIALIZER IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO PLACE A SOUND IN A SPACE, THUS THE NAME.
// ADDING ROOM SIZE TO A SPAIZALIZER TO CONTROL REVERB AMOUNT WOULD GET INTO THE INTERFAXE OF AURALIZER
// UNLESS NOT SPECIFIED? NAHH!

/*
For now use Freeverb as the reverberator. In the future, a base reverb class should exist, 
allowing to specify the type of reverb. Although this would call for a subclass of Auralizer, 
rather than using setter functions, where by default it gets constructed to use Freverb, but
A subclass could just place any other reverb.
*/

/*
The reverb settings would be set depending on the room specified.
The "Room" Class should have a method for returning volume, as well as average absorption
(in order to set the tail properties, as well as calculating reflections.

The calculation of early reflections should also share a common base class, so that subclasses
can initialize the "geometer" to any desired one."

//I GUESS I'VE FOUND A SOLUTION TO THE SPATIALIZER "CONTAINER".
//FIRST, IT WONT BE A SPATIALIZER, BUT THE AURALIZER WILL COME A LEVEL DOWN, AND BE ITSELF THE SPATIALIZER.
//THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT BY DEFAULT IT WON'T DEAL WITH ROOM MODELS. (IT COULD POSSIBLY BE A SUBCLASS OF SPATIALIZER IF THE "ECHO" INFO 
//BECOMES TO COMPLICATED TO HAVE FOR EVERY SPATIALIZER.
//
//HERE IT GOES:
//WHEN ADDING A SOURCE TO THE SPATIALIZER, THIS WILL MAKE A DISTANCE_SIMULATOR AND PASS IT THE ADDED SOURCE. THEN, IT'LL CALL "ADD SOURCE" OF THE
//PANNER AND WILL PASS IT THE NEW CREATED DISTANCE SIMULATOR. 
//IN THE NEXT BUFFER OF THE SPATIALIZER, THIS WILL CALL NEXT BUFFER OF THE PANNER, WHICH IN TURN WILL CALL NEXT BUFFER OF EACH SOURCE, MEANING EACH DISTANCE SIMULATOR
//WHICH IN TURN IT'LL CAL THE NEXT BUFFER OF EACH PASSED SOURCE.
