/**
A speaker layout holds a set of loudspeakers.
Each speaker has a position (in a space, where measurements are assumed to be from the center point of the space (also the center of the coordinate system).
To simplify usage, a default layout will be created when instantiating any object that uses the speaker layout.
If the user does not specify a layout then the default layout is used.
Any layout can be set to become default (by calling setDefaultSpeakerLayout()) so new objects that require a SpeakerLayout
make use of this prefered layout without the need of passing it explicitly per instance.
Using multiple layouts is still possible by passing the desired layout to the object that will use it.
In that case, this object will go with this layout instead of the default.

Conventions used in this code:
Coordinate system:
	- Left oriented
	- Internal angle representation: spherical radians
	- Azimuth = 0 on the x/z plane and increasing towards the positive y direction
	- Elevation = 0 on x/y plane and increasing towards the positive z direction

the layout is a passive object, meaning that it doesn't deal with processing any audio data. It only provides speaker positions.
An "ActiveSpeakerLayout" is active and can be used as a UnitGenerator that compensates for speaker positions, etc.
