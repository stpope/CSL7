///
///	Filters.h -- CSL filter classes.
///	
///	The base Filter class can perform the generic filter equation based upon a set of feedback 
/// and feedforward coefficients. Subclasses of Filter implement the setupCoeffs method to build 
/// these coefficients according to different algorithms.
///	The subclasses here mostly inherit from the FrequencyAmount controllable, which specifies a 
/// center frequency and an 'amount' which may variously be resonance, radius, bandwidth etc 
/// according to the algorithm.
///	
///	OK so for example Butter class has a CenterFrequency port and a Bandwidth port,
/// but pull_controls must be calling Controllables to do the pullInput()
///	
///	Or, a generic filter that can take a multichannel UGen for each of aCoeffs and bCoeffs (i.e. 
///	multichannel ports), and other filter classes that wrap this and have Frequency and Bandwidth ports etc.
///	This reduces the calls to setupCoeffs, because they'd actually be part of the nextBuffer instead
///	
///	The reason is that the Scalable type approach & macros can't be extended to filter otherwise.
///	ALSO, there are no similar macros for Effect; how should this work?
///	
///	OK, the way he had it working here is filtering in place, i.e. no internal buffer, 
/// but if I inherit from Effect, I do have	an internal buffer; this means the first thing to do is 
/// memcopy the input to the output, then pounce on that; or do the in-place stuff in the Effect port 
/// and finally copy to output, say with scale & offset performed there.
