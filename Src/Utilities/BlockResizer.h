///  BlockResizer.h -- Regularizes the amount of data called for, 
///		meaning that different parts of a graph can run at different callback block sizes.
/// 	This is useful for time-frequency transformations that only work with fixed buffer sizes.
///		A BlockResizer either caches large blocks between multiple smaller callbacks, or it calls a 
///		smaller-block-size graph several times per larger-sized downstream callbacks.
///		BlockResizer works for up-block and down-block situations.
///		This version also handles multi-channel mapping, so you can use a mono input and ask it for 
///		multi-channel output; it will copy.
