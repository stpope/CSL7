CSL List of ThingsToDo

Broken demo fcns:
	Multi-tap delay demo mixer
	testEnvScale has clicks
	Sample-avg filter
	HRTF pretty crappy, crashes (space leak?)
	VBAP threading broken
	FIR filter design breaks for complex filters
	MIDI input hard-wired to device 0 and is very verbose
	Audio input works, but mic processing is dodgy

Windows issues:
	FFT/IFFT untested
	SHARC uses UNIX-specific code.

Bugs:
	Multi-out fan-out broken (see FIR demo)

	Block resizer up-sampling
	Env as scaled has clicks
	Moog filter untested
	ADSR/AR time scaling - setDuration should not scale whole envelope

Unfinished:

Improvements:
	ExpSeg and Spline envelopes
	Add symmetrical filter constructors (cf/bw as floats/UGens)
	Copy constructors all around

New features:
	SampleRateConvertor and support for multiple rates in a graph

Meta-issues
	Doc, doc, and more doc (CSL tutorial?)
